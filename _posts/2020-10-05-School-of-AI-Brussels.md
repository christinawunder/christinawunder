## What is the School of AI?

At the [School of AI Brussels](http://schoolofai.brussels), we organise regular meetups that are designed for people who want to learn about artificial intelligence, machine learning and data science - no matter what skills level.

[Saida](https://www.linkedin.com/in/saidaah/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_pulse_read%3BVM9JlppVRTe0ipdiuIzHiA%3D%3D) and I founded the School of AI Brussels in 2019.
The rationale: creating an in-person and offline experience for people who are learning about AI - because a lot of this learning happens at a computer screen and online.
But we knew from our own experience that having interactions with other people in real life note only makes the learning journey more fun - it also helps us to stay motivated and hold each other accountable.

## Community events

The School of AI meet-ups take place at regular intervals in Brussels, and are open for absolute beginners, developers and AI experts. Here, we learn about some basic concepts and use-cases of artificial intelligence, and discuss some of its challenges and opportunities.

In our hands-on coding workshops, we explore different aspects of artificial intelligence, machine learning and data science together - for example exploratory data analyses, data visualisation, or different machine learning methods.

## Beginners should expect:
- A place to discuss and share what they're learning, as they start and continue their learning journey (e.g. with online resources such as the "School of AI" courses or many others).
- A chance to discuss the topic with people a bit more advanced than them.
- The opportunity to do some hands-on coding, with the guidance from the School of AI Brussels organisers, as well as more advanced participants.

## More advanced people should expect
- A forum to share their ideas and expertise, and to get to know people interested in what they do.
- A chance to discuss their field of work with other experts, or to learn about others' fields of expertise.
- Gain new perspectives onto their field of expertise, by engaging with subject matter experts from different areas of work and research.
